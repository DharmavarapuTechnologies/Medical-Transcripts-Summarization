        "# **INTRODUCTION**\n",
        "This notebook was developed by 4 members namely Mohanteja, Suhan, vignesh and Vivek which explains the code for the models we developed to summarize medical report of a patient and also compare's the results of the various models we used with rouge metric and explains which model is predicting good summaries with good rouge score and why.\n",
        "\n",
        "**TEXT SUMMARIZATION:**\n",
        "Using Deep Learning, we can implement tasks belongs NLP or Computer Vision became easy by using various neural netwok algorithms. Text summarization is a task of reducing the length of big article, book, report, etc., and gives a brief explanation in few sentences without loosing the meaning of original context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NEURAL NETWORK:**\n",
        "computer network which try to mimic human brain and try to perform activities like human brain using numerous artificial neurons are called neural networks, there are 3 types of neural networks,\n",
        "1. Convolutional neural networks\n",
        "2. Recurssive Neural Networks\n",
        "3. Transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Convolutional neural networks (CNN):**\n",
        "    the idea of having sliding window that reduces things down to fewer dimensions. It is good for images and videos but not so much for language data i.e., NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recursive Neural Networks (RNN):**\n",
        "    same as CNN will have sliding windows that moves along an input sequence. main advantage of RNN over CNN is it could remember the data from previous few sequence of data from previous neurons. Its good with sequence data and had few successful applications in NLP tasks but limits to how much we can parallelize training\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transformers:**\n",
        "    Transformers is very new concept in neural network which was introduced in the year 2017. Unlike CNN and RNN, transformers can train the model with entire data as an input in one go. the tasks with transformers can be higly parallelized and the results of NLP tasks are pretty good compared to RNN.\n",
        "    \n",
        "# We used 2 RNN models LSTM and GRU to develop our model from scratch and also used few state of the art pretrained models to predict and compare the results with the results we got from our models. The state of the art models that we used are developed based on transformers and the pretrained models we used are BART, PEGASUS, T5 and used them to compare our results with LSTM, GRU models that were developed by us from scratch and trained on the medical dataset we choose. We couldn't be able to implement BERT model for summaries bacause, BERT is masked word bidirectional encoder which is suitable for text completion or language translation but for text summarization, it is not suitable. We also fine tuned t5 model and BART model with our medical dataset to check weather it is predicting good summaries then pretrained model.\n",

        "# **MOTIVATION**\n",
        "The motivation behind choosing text summarization of patient's medical reports is that there so many medical reports of so many people and it is very time consuming to go through the complete report to find the correct problem the patient is suffering from. So, if there is small brief explaination of the entire report of the patient, then it will become easy for doctors or even for normal people to easily understand what patient is suffering from and what needs to be done to cure it, in less amount of time. So, that's the reason why we choose the project of summarizing the patient's medical report.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **PROBLEM STATEMENNT**\n",
        "The main purpose of our project is to summarize the long medical reports of a patint. A medical report of a patient might be very long and could be many pages and going through the complete report for doctors to find out what patient is suffering from might be very time consuming. So, we thought of summarizing that whole report and give the brief explanation on what the patient is suffering from which will reduce so much time for doctors from reading the entire medical report."

trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  the patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 endo tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 endo tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  a careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  after removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  the mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  stent material was removed from this area as well.  in the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  all visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  initial attempt to place a #16 montgomery t tube showed the distal lumen of the t tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  also, this was removed and a #8 shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  a good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  the distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  this secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 vicryl.  the skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 prolene.  tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the intensive care unit in satisfactory condition.  the patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.\",\n",

operation: , salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis.,anesthesia: , general endotracheal with epidural.,indications:  ,this patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy.  he was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising psa.  after that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  one year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  he had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  there were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  he wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  i took him to the operating room on january 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  we both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  i felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,findings: , at exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  the bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  the opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, i elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  a nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  he was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  a generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  moist wound towels and a bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  we began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  the ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  an identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,we began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  this was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  we essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  we then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  there was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  we then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  we then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,we then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  this allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,we then turned our attention to forming the indiana pouch.  i completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  the colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a gia-80 stapler.  i then divided the avascular plane of treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  the mesentery was then sealed with a ligasure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a gia-60 stapler.  we then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a gia-80 stapler, closing the open end with a ta 60.  the angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,we then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-french robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the gia-60 stapler.  the ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-french robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic \"pop,\" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,as the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  we then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 vicryl sutures.  the bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the sgia polysorb-75.  between the staple lines, vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 vicryl suture ligatures.,we then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  the left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a cook 8.4-french ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  the right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  we then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  a 24-french malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  the staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a ta 60 polysorb suture.  the pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,we then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  the cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  we then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  we removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  a portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  we left an 18-french robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  the malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,we matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  the stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the malecot to the left lower quadrant.  a large jp drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the indiana pouch.,the rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  the estimated blood loss was 450 ml, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  the final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.  the patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the

at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  at this point, dr. x used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  dr. y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  dr. x and dr. y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with dr. y being on the lateral aspect of the area and dr. x on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  the tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  the patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  ultimately, dr. y and dr. x both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where dr. y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  dr. x then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  dr. y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  dr. y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  dr. y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  dr. x then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  the stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by dr. y and dr. x closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  this opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  dr. y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  electrocautery was used on the base.  there was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  dermabond and gelfoam were placed, and then dr. y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  dr. x then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 vicryl in 3 layers.  dr. y closed the scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 vicryl and 4-0 rapide respectively.  a 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by dr. y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by dr. y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a foley catheter placed in the bladder.  the foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  a second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.\",\n",

thrombosis.,procedure in detail: , prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by dr. a without any difficulty.  the patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  a sterile 16-french foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  a midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  the rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the bovie.  transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  a bookwalter retractor was then placed.  the area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  given this patient's low gleason score and low psa with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the metzenbaum scissors.  opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  the dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  the deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using allis also and ligated by using 0 vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  with the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the bovie.  deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using metzenbaum scissors.  the urethra could then be easily identified.  nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using metzenbaum scissors.  this exposed the blue foley catheter.  anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 monocryl suture.  six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  the foley catheter was then removed.  this allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  this effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  the prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  the floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  the prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  the prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  the dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  the prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  the bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  this was developed without any difficulty.  both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  the seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  about two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  the tip was left behind.  using the bipolar gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  this was performed on the left side and then the right side.  this completely freed the prostate.  the prostate was sent for permanent section.  the opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  the ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  the previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  this was performed by using a french ***** needle.  a 20-french foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  a 15 ml of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  the bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  a 19-french blake drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  all instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  the rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 pds.  subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 vicryl sutures.  the skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the

therapy.,procedure in detail:  ,the patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  after institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  the patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  sequential compression devices were also placed.  next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  a low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using co2 gas.  next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  the camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  the robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  at this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  it became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  these arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  the pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  a total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  at this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  the proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  we then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 monocryl sutures.  before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  this was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  this was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 monocryl sutures.  next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  next, gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  there was no obvious urine extravasation.  at this time, the procedure was terminated.  the robot was undocked.  under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  also, notably a jackson-pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  the patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,disposition: , the patient was discharged to post anesthesia care unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to
