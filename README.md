# Medical-Transcripts-Summarization

Its a research project which is a part of Neural Network and Deep Learning course where the model will summarize the Medical Reports of a patients 
to help doctor to have a quick look and diagnize patient with what is wrong with them. It was a group project with 4 members in our group where we all research and 
developed 5 models using LSTM, GRU, BART, T5 and Pegasus. 

We compared all the 5 models to check the accuracy and rouge score between in which we found that Pegasus is performing way better than others in summarization. 
Pegasus is intially developed for text summarization task, so, that may be the reason why it is performing better at summarization
